This workshop guides participants through building a chatbot for a hair salon using Telegram and AI models like OpenAI and Ollama. It focuses on integrating large language models (LLMs) with the [Vercel SDK AI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) to create an intelligent bot that can handle appointment bookings. The workshop is organized by the [Aula de Software Libre de la University of Cordoba](https://www.uco.es/aulasoftwarelibre).
